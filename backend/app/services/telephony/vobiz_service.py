"""
Vobiz REST + XML service — India carrier route, mirrors telnyx_service.py.

Architecture differs from Telnyx on purpose:
- Telnyx: REST call-control actions (POST /calls/{id}/actions/answer|speak|...),
  with call.speak.ended webhooks telling you exactly when TTS finished.
- Vobiz:  XML-driven answer_url response for call setup (Plivo-compatible),
  plus REST "Speak Text" to play TTS into an already-answered call — but
  with NO completion webhook. We estimate playback duration instead and
  sleep that long before unmuting Deepgram. See estimate_speech_seconds().

VERIFY BEFORE PRODUCTION: the exact Speak Text endpoint path/params below
are inferred from Vobiz's documented Plivo-compatible API shape — their
docs describe the feature but didn't expose a literal request schema at
time of writing. Run one real outbound test call and check your Vobiz
console's request logs against this before trusting it for campaigns.
