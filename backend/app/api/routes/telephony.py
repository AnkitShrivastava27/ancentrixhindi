Telephony utility routes — small helper endpoints used by the frontend.

The actual call flow (answer/gather/hangup XML webhooks) lives entirely in
vobiz_webhook.py now that Telnyx has been removed. This file only exposes:
  GET  /telephony/numbers            — the company's configured Vobiz DID
  POST /telephony/calls/{cid}/hangup — force-hangup a live call
  GET  /telephony/calls/{cid}/transcript — last live transcript line

    BUG FIX (Aug 2026): this previously called vobiz_service.hangup(cid)
    with NO company argument — vobiz_service._creds(None) returns EMPTY
    auth_id/auth_token, so every hangup attempt was silently failing
    against Vobiz's API for every company, regardless of who called it
    (confirmed by reading _creds()'s fallback logic: it only fills in
    default creds for the shared demo account, not a bare None). This
    button looked like it didn't exist because it was completely
    non-functional, not missing. Also added an ownership check that
    didn't exist before — nothing previously verified `cid` actually
    belonged to the calling user's own company before asking Vobiz to
