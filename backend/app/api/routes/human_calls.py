# app/api/routes/human_calls.py
#
# "Human Call" tab — leads assigned to a Batch with agent_type="human" are
# NOT auto-dialed by the AI (see the agent_type check in
# app/tasks/tasks.py's schedule dispatch loop). Instead they show up here
# for an agent to work manually.
#
# DIAL MECHANISM — click-to-call bridge, not literal browser WebRTC audio:
# This project's entire Vobiz integration (see
# app/services/telephony/vobiz_service.py) is a Plivo-compatible REST
# call-creation + XML answer_url flow — there is no WebRTC SDK usage
# anywhere in this codebase, and nothing here can verify Vobiz's account
# actually supports one. Rather than build a telephony feature against an
# unverified API surface, "Dial" here does the same thing proven to work
# for AI calls (make_outbound_call): Vobiz rings the AGENT's own phone
# first; once they pick up, the answer_url below returns Plivo/Vobiz XML
# that bridges the live leg straight into the lead's number. The agent
# ends up talking to the lead over a normal phone call, using the
# company's Vobiz caller ID — same underlying call quality/reliability as
# every AI call this system already places, just with a human on the
# audio instead of the AI pipeline. If a true in-browser softphone is
# still wanted, it needs confirming with Vobiz support first (ask for
# "Endpoint"/WebRTC SDK docs for this account) — swap this file's dial()
# for that once confirmed; nothing else in the Human Call flow depends on
# which transport actually carries the audio.

    BUG FIX (Aug 2026): <Dial> requires a nested <Number> element —
    <Dial>{phone}</Dial> with the number as bare text content is NOT
    valid Plivo/Vobiz XML (confirmed against Plivo's own XML reference:

    Vobiz received that malformed instruction, couldn't execute it, and

    drop 1-2 seconds after the agent answered.

    BUG FIX 2 (Aug 2026): the docstring above always claimed this uses
    "the same caller ID the company already dials out with", but the XML
    never actually set one — <Dial> had no `callerId` attribute. Without
    an explicit, registered caller ID, Vobiz/Indian-carrier DLT rules
    commonly reject or immediately drop an outbound leg with no caller ID
    attached. That's why the bridge could connect (agent answers, this
    endpoint returns 200) and then hang up again within a couple of
    seconds the moment Vobiz tried to actually Dial the lead — the second
    leg never went through. Explicitly setting callerId to the company's
