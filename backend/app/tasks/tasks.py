    - Always dispatch exactly ONE lead per tick (per_tick forced to 1).
    - Before dispatching, check Redis for an active call on this batch.
      If one is in progress, skip this tick entirely and wait for it to finish.
    - The call sets a Redis lock on answer and releases it on hangup.
      (See telephony.py _on_answered and _on_hangup — they call
       batch_call_lock.acquire/release via the helpers below.)

# ── Redis batch call lock helpers ─────────────────────────────────────────────
# These are lightweight Redis keys used to serialize calls within a batch.
# Key: batch_call_active:{batch_id}  → call_control_id or "pending"
# Key: batch_call_cooldown:{batch_id} → "1" during delay_between_seconds window

# ── Sync Redis helpers for batch call locking ────────────────────────────────
# These use synchronous redis-py calls because they run inside Celery tasks
# which use run_async() with a fresh event loop per task. Using an async Redis
# client across different event loops causes silent failures where get() always
# returns None, making the lock check useless. Sync Redis avoids this entirely.
