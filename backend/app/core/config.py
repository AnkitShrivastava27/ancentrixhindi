    # it's a real empty-string VALUE, which then gets fed into that
    # field's type coercion — fine for a plain `str` field, but a hard
    # crash for anything else: `DB_STATEMENT_CACHE_SIZE=` (Optional[int])
    # raised "Input should be a valid integer... input_value=''". This
    # isn't a one-field problem — 27 fields in this class alone are
    # int/float/bool/Optional[int]/Optional[float], every one of them a
    # landmine under the exact same blank-line pattern. Rather than patch
    # each one as it's individually hit, this strips any blank-string
    # value out of the merged env data BEFORE pydantic's per-field type

    # ── CORS ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    # BUG FIX: a plain List[str] field crashes on startup if the .env value
    # is a comma-separated string instead of a JSON array — pydantic-
    # settings auto-JSON-decodes any env var backing a "complex" type
    # (list/dict/set/...), and that decode happens in the settings SOURCE
    # layer, BEFORE any field_validator gets a chance to run (confirmed by
    # actually reproducing the crash — a validator alone does not fix
    # this). The fix here is deliberately version-independent — verified
    # against pydantic-settings==2.6.1 specifically, the version actually
    # pinned in requirements.txt (an earlier attempt using pydantic-
    # settings' NoDecode marker worked on 2.15.0 but doesn't exist at all
    # in 2.6.1 — checked directly, not assumed): read it as a plain `str`,
    # which never triggers the complex-type auto-decode in ANY version,
    # via `validation_alias` so the .env key stays ALLOWED_ORIGINS, and
    # expose the real List[str] as a computed @property under the same
    # public name every caller already uses — a property reads identically
    # to a field from the outside, so main.py's CORS middleware setup
    # needs zero changes.

    # These are used for two DIFFERENT purposes and deliberately kept
    # separate — collapsing them into one setting was a real bug (Aug
    # 2026): Cashfree's return_url is only ever navigated to by the
    # PERSON'S OWN BROWSER after checkout, so it never needs to be
    # internet-reachable — http://localhost:3000 works fine for local
    # dev. notify_url is called SERVER-TO-SERVER by Cashfree itself and
    # genuinely does need a public tunnel (ngrok/cloudflared) in local
    # dev. Forcing both through the same tunnel URL meant a flaky local
    # tunnel dying broke the person's own post-payment redirect, which
    # never needed to leave their machine in the first place.

    # PUBLIC_BASE_URL: this backend's own public address — Vobiz
    # answer/hangup webhooks, human-call bridge webhooks, and Cashfree's
    # notify_url all use this. Needs a real tunnel/domain even in local
    # dev, since external services call it. Was TELNYX_WEBHOOK_BASE_URL;
